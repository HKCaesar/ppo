# Plant Phenology Ontology

If you are interested in exploring the Plant Phenology Ontology (PPO), our most recent build is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlantPhenoOntology/PPO/master/ontology/ppo.owl).  Note that the PPO is under active development and not yet stable enough for routine use.

If you are interested in PPO development, extensive documentation covering the PPO build system and development process is available on the project wiki.  This documentation includes:

* [Building the PPO](../../wiki/Building-the-PPO): How to buld the import modules and compile the PPO.
* [Managing imports](../../wiki/Managing-imports): How to edit existing import modules and create new ones.
* [Ontology development](../../wiki/Ontology-development): How to edit and create PPO classes.
* [Creating a new release](../../wiki/Creating-a-release): How to generate a new PPO release.
