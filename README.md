# Plant Phenology Ontology

## Latest release

The latest release of the PPO can be found in the folder [releases/2018-07-31](https://github.com/PlantPhenoOntology/ppo/tree/master/releases/2018-07-31).  You will find three representations of the PPO in the release folder.
  1. [ppo.owl](https://github.com/PlantPhenoOntology/ppo/raw/master/releases/2017-10-20/ppo.owl): This is a "reasoned" version of the ontology with all imports merged into the main ontology document.  Unless you specifically require an unreasoned representation of the PPO, this is the ontology file you should use.
  2. [ppo-raw.owl](https://github.com/PlantPhenoOntology/ppo/raw/master/releases/2017-10-20/ppo-raw.owl): This is an unreasoned version of the ontology with imported entities in separate import modules.
  3. [ppo-merged.owl](https://github.com/PlantPhenoOntology/ppo/raw/master/releases/2017-10-20/ppo-merged.owl): This is an unreasoned version of the ontology with all imports merged into the main ontology document.

If you are interested in PPO development, extensive documentation covering the PPO build system and development process is available on the PPO project wiki and at the [documentation for OntoPilot](https://github.com/stuckyb/ontopilot), which we use to manage ontology development.
