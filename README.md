# Plant Phenology Ontology

If you are interested in exploring the Plant Phenology Ontology (PPO), our most recent build is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlantPhenoOntology/ppo/master/ontology/ppo-reasoned.owl).

If you are interested in PPO development, extensive documentation covering the PPO build system and development process is available on the PPO project wiki and at the [documentation for OntoPilot](https://github.com/stuckyb/ontopilot), which we use to manage ontology development.  PPO-specific development documentation includes:

* [Building the PPO](../../wiki/Building-the-PPO): How to buld the import modules and compile the PPO.
* [Managing imports](../../wiki/Managing-imports): How to edit existing import modules and create new ones.
* [Ontology development](../../wiki/Ontology-development): How to edit and create PPO classes.
* [Creating a new release](../../wiki/Creating-a-release): How to generate a new PPO release.
