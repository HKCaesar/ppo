# The Plant Phenology Ontology: Term Definitions and Documentation

The PPO can be logically divided into two sets of classes: first, classes for [phenological stages](#phenological-stages), and second, classes for [phenological traits](#phenological-traits).  These classes work together, along with supporting classes from other key ontologies, to describe the phenology of a particular plant or plant community at some place and time.

## Data properties

- ID: PPO:'lower count'
- ID: PPO:'upper count'
- ID: PPO:'lower percent'
- ID: PPO:'upper percent'

## Phenological traits: top-level trait classes

- ID: PPO:'plant structure presence'
  descendants: all
  filter_by_label: "presence"
- ID: PPO:'abscised plant structure presence'
  descendants: all
  filter_by_label: "presence"


## Phenological traits: "present" trait classes

Note that each phenological trait documented here also has two convenience subclasses, one for the case where a particular feature of a plant is present and for when it is absent.  So, for example, "mature_leaf_presence" has subclasses "mature_leaves_present" and "mature_leaves_absent".  For ease of readibility, these present/absent classes are not included here, but they are often useful when constructing phenology instance data.

- ID: PPO:'initial shoot growth present'
  descendants: all
- ID: PPO:'leaf buds present'
  descendants: all
- ID: PPO:'vascular leaves present'
  descendants: all
- ID: PPO:'reproductive structures present'
  descendants: all
- ID: PPO:'abscised plant structures present'
  descendants: all


## Phenological traits: "absent" trait classes
- ID: PPO:'plant structure presence'
  descendants: all
  filter_by_label: "absent"
- ID: PPO:'abscised plant structure presence'
  descendants: all
  filter_by_label: "absent"


## Plant structures

Many of the plant structures used in the PPO are defined in the Plant Ontology (PO).  Here, we only include the PO plant structures that are most relevant to users of the PPO.

- ID: PO:'plant structure'
  children:
    - ID: PPO:'reproductive structure'
      descendants: all
    - ID: PO:'bud'
      descendants: all
    - ID: PPO:'initial shoot growth'
      descendants: all
    - ID: PO:'vascular leaf'
      descendants: all
    - ID: PO:'seed'
      descendants: all
    - ID: PO:'whole plant'
      descendants: all
